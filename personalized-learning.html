    <h3>What is Personalized Learning?</h3>
    <p>
        Personalized learning is an educational approach that tailors teaching methods, resources, and learning activities 
        to the unique needs, preferences, and abilities of individual students. This approach recognizes that each learner 
        is different and ensures that everyone has the best possible opportunity to succeed.
    </p>

    <h3>How Technology Enhances Personalized Learning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Learning Platforms:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT and AI-driven platforms can assess a student's 
            current level of understanding and adapt content delivery to their needs in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analytics:</strong> Technologies that analyze student performance data can provide educators 
            with insights into strengths, weaknesses, and progress, helping them create targeted interventions.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Content:</strong> Interactive tools such as simulations, games, and virtual labs allow 
            students to learn at their own pace while exploring complex topics in engaging ways.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Tools:</strong> Students can use shared platforms like Notion to track their goals 
            and monitor their own learning progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Personalized Learning in Action</h3>
    <p>
        1. <strong>Using ChatGPT for Real-Time Support:</strong> A student struggling with mathematics can use ChatGPT 
        to get step-by-step solutions to equations, detailed explanations of concepts, and even suggestions for additional practice problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <strong>Customizing Study Plans:</strong> A teacher can input a student's learning goals and schedule into ChatGPT to generate 
        a tailored weekly or monthly study plan, complete with recommended resources and milestones.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <strong>Leveraging Interactive Quizzes:</strong> Platforms like Quizizz can provide instant feedback on assessments, 
        enabling students to focus on areas that need improvement.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Personalized Learning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students learn at their own pace, ensuring a deeper understanding of the material.</li>
        <li>Increases motivation and engagement by aligning content with student interests.</li>
        <li>Encourages self-directed learning, fostering independence and confidence.</li>
        <li>Provides immediate feedback to students and teachers, improving outcomes.</li>
